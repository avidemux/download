Avidemux is a freeware for video editing that supports numerous video, audio and container formats across platforms. As a rule, they can convert them among themselves. Among other things (only excerpts!) AVI, XVID, DivX, MPEG 1/2/4, H263(+), OGM, MOV/3GP, MP3, AAC, WMA and WAV.
Avidemux offers practically the support of all common formats and codecs today, as far as they are used by a significant number of users.

## Classification of Avidemux
The functionality of Avidemux is similar to that of other non-commercial video editing programs such as AviSynth or VirtualDub, in some places Avidemux can do more. Therefore, today it is the most common freeware for video editing. This is partly due to fine details such as native support for OGM/MPEG-4 files, which VirtualDub does not offer. Well over a million people use Avidemux.

The software can be downloaded on the provider's website and on several other portals, including Linux distributions as a package. The focus is clearly on platform independence and the very high number of formats and filters supported by default. Four sound tracks can be used, depending on the audio format, different channels are available per track. The high compatibility of Avidemux makes it possible, among other things, to save the same editing for several videos as a script, which can then be applied to any number of files.

## Interface

Most users will use the graphical user interface, but script operation at the command line level via SpiderMonkey (a JavaScript interpreter) is also possible. For the graphical user interface there are the two variants of the Bibliothenbasis GTK+ or Qt. Since these two libraries run on all common operating systems, Avidemux works platform-independent.

For the iPhone and iPod, Microsoft Zune and the Sony PlayStation Portable there is a wizard for conversion. Through the user interface, framing is possible, that is, the accurate cutting of individual images and the composition of videos. This is even possible without a surface for the purpose of batch processing on the server. The many video filters, which were partly taken from AviSynth and MPlayer and can also be extended via plug-in, offer the following functions:

* Transformation (Mplayer/Avisynth Resize, crop, rotation etc.)
* Colors (Contrast, MPlayer EQ, Luma EQ, Chroma Shift)
* Deinterlacing (Kerneldeinterlacer, Yadif, TDeint, FFMpeg Deinterlacer, DGBob etc.)
* Noise Reduction (Fluxsmooth, MPlayer Denoise 3D, TemporalCleaner, Stabilize)
* Subtitles (AAS/SSA, SRT/SUB, VobSub)
* Image sharpness (Msharpen, aSharp, Gauss Smooth and Median Filters)
* Removing bezels and logos
* Recording of video files as well as multiplexing and demultiplexing
* With the JavaScript engine, extensive remote control of the program functions via script is possible.

## Avidemux Portable
Avidemux Portable is the portable version, it does not need to be installed and fits on a USB stick. If you're on the go and want to quickly edit a video on any computer, just plug in a USB stick with Avidemux Portable. The software works at the destination by simply inserting the stick without further installation.
